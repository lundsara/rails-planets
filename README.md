![orbits](https://iwsmt-content-ok2nbdvvyp8jbrhdp.stackpathdns.com/2282013232750iAtC2afkODS6U.gif)

Tonight you'll be making a little baby rails app about PLANETS!!!! It'll be super similar to today's Compliments app lab. Gotta get those reps in!!! 💪💪💪

[Here is your planet object!](./planets.rb) Use it wisely...

You'll be creating a bunch of routes & views using this object!

- `/`: Should have a welcome message and a link to the planets page
- `/planets`: Has a list of all the planets
- `/planets/:planet`: Returns information about that specific planet
- `/planets/random`: Returns a random planet

### Bonus!!

- Style it up! Flex those flexbox muscles.

## 🚀 Completion looks like:

- You have a Rails app in this repo
    - **REMEMBER**: Initialize your rails app using `rails new -G planets`.
- Your rails app has the routes & views described above.

## 🚀 Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due 🚨 11PM ON THURSDAY NIGHT 🚨
